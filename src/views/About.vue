        👋Hey! I'm Gerald Jackson, a Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya
        🇰🇪. I thrive on solving problems and exploring innovative ideas .
        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at
        Kenyatta University, where I'm in my second year of study. I enjoy
        writing technical articles where I share my experiences tackling complex
        issues in software development. I believe in the power of knowledge
        sharing, and I hope my articles can help others facing similar
        challenges.

      When I'm not writing code, you can often find me playing FIFA and chess,
      finding both strategy games immensely enjoyable. Additionally, I love
      listening to music, with Kendrick Lamar being my favorite artist.
